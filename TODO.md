 * seperate commands-only def command should be inline for subsystems
 * auto recv
 * encoder values for intake
 * test intake rollers
 * robot charecterization
 * duel controllers

 on auto recv:
     * call arms to move
     * trigger binding part 2 to arms both in place
    ### part 2
     * set all rollers
     * run for fixed time
     * stop rollers
     * is fineshed
    ### end
     * remove triggers
     * run intake rollers in reverse to purge note(if stuck/still in intake)

triggers cant unbind?
manual if logic should be used to stop the bindigns later
